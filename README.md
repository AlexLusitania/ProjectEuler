## What ?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. Found out more [here](http://projecteuler.net).

## Why ?
I like challenges and it's very fun coding and learning all the mathematics behind the ProjectEuler's challenges.

## How ?
Depending on the problem and my mood, I may be using :

* :camel: OCaml (functional programming language),
* :snake: Python 3.4 (scripting language),
* ...

**NB:** I do not pretend all my attempts to be perfect, some of these may even look naive for advanced mathematicians or advanced computer scientist :monkey:
