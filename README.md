## What ?
[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems.

## How to run the solutions?
### OCaml
In the folder of the problem you want to see resolved:
```bash
ocaml something.ml # will display the result
```

### Haskell
In the folder of the problem you want to see resolved:
```bash
cabal run # will build and run it to display the result
```

**NB:** Some of my attempts are far from perfect, some of these might actually look naive for mathematicians or experienced computer scientist.
